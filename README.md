Thanks to norwayjohn for his peaceful [ocean sounds](https://freesound.org/people/norwayjohn/sounds/404686/).

The file `music/ocean-min.mp3` is an `.mp3` conversion of his original `.wav` file, which was provided as [Creative Commons 0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), and so this `.mp3` version is also covered under the CC0 license in this repository.

All font files in the folder `fonts/nimblebeastscollective.itch.io/*` were provided as [Creative Commons 0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), and so they are also covered under the same license in this repository.

#### Nonsensical 2D ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/@Nonsensical2D))

Thanks to Nonsensical 2D whose [video about nice looking autotiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtvPeEMSY3k) helped me design the tilemaps for this game.
The layer masks used in the `art/tileset-sand-path.kra` and `art/tileset-water.kra` project files are essentially modelled directly from his excellent [Free Autotile textures](https://www.patreon.com/posts/free-autotile-115217340). 

This `.psd` file was provided without an explicit license listed, and I couldn't find a way to get in touch with him, and so I didn't include any of his original work in the project repo. He has my thanks regardless.
